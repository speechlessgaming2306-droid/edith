> Edith

Edith is a sophisticated AI assistant designed for multimodal interaction. It combines Google's Gemini 2.5 Native Audio with computer vision, gesture control, and 3D CAD generation in a Electron desktop application.

## Railway Deployment

Edith can now be deployed to [Railway](https://railway.app/) as a single web service.

### What changed for hosted deployment

- The FastAPI + Socket.IO backend now binds to Railway's `PORT` automatically.
- The backend serves the built React frontend from `dist/`.
- Browser deployments connect to the backend over the same origin instead of assuming `localhost:8000`.
- Hosted browser sessions start in a text-first mode by default, so Railway does not need a local microphone or speaker device.
- `requirements.txt` is now cloud-safe for Railway, and local hardware/desktop dependencies were moved to `requirements-local.txt`.

### Files added for deployment

- [`Dockerfile`](/Users/ritu/Documents/GitHub/harv%202/harv/Dockerfile)
- [`.dockerignore`](/Users/ritu/Documents/GitHub/harv%202/harv/.dockerignore)
- [`backend/settings.example.json`](/Users/ritu/Documents/GitHub/harv%202/harv/backend/settings.example.json)
- [`requirements-local.txt`](/Users/ritu/Documents/GitHub/harv%202/harv/requirements-local.txt)

### Recommended Railway environment variables

Required:

- `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `HARVEY_ACCESS_CODE`

Recommended:

- `MEM0_API_KEY`
- `MEM0_USER_ID`
- `MEM0_APP_ID=edith`
- `EDITH_COMPANION_TOKEN`
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI`
- `POLLINATIONS_API_KEY`

Optional profile variables:

- `EDITH_LOCATION_LABEL`
- `EDITH_CITY`
- `EDITH_REGION`
- `EDITH_COUNTRY`
- `EDITH_TIMEZONE`
- `EDITH_VOICE_MODE`

### Important hosted limitations

- Live server-side microphone capture is disabled by default for remote browser sessions.
- Server-side audio playback is disabled by default for remote browser sessions.
- Text chat, Mem0 memory, browser camera uploads, document generation, and backend tools still work.
- Local-machine actions such as opening Mac apps, clipboard access, printers, and other desktop-native actions should be handled through the Edith companion on your own machine, not directly by the Railway container.
- Desktop-only dependencies like `pyaudio`, `opencv-python`, `mediapipe`, `mss`, `pyautogui`, `playwright`, and `build123d` are intentionally excluded from Railway installs.

If you intentionally want the Railway container to try server-side audio playback, set:

- `EDITH_ENABLE_REMOTE_SERVER_AUDIO=true`

### Dependency split

- Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` on Railway / cloud servers.
- Use `pip install -r requirements-local.txt` on your own machine for the full desktop Edith stack.

## 🌟 Capabilities at a Glance

| Feature | Description | Technology |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **🗣️ Low-Latency Voice** | Real-time conversation with interrupt handling | Gemini 2.5 Native Audio |
| **🧊 Parametric CAD** | Editable 3D model generation from voice prompts | `build123d` → STL |
| **🖨️ 3D Printing** | Slicing and wireless print job submission | OrcaSlicer + Moonraker/OctoPrint |
| **🖐️ Minority Report UI** | Gesture-controlled window manipulation | MediaPipe Hand Tracking |
| **👁️ Face Authentication** | Secure local biometric login | MediaPipe Face Landmarker |
| **🌐 Web Agent** | Autonomous browser automation | Playwright + Chromium |
| **🏠 Smart Home** | Voice control for TP-Link Kasa devices | `python-kasa` |
| **📁 Project Memory** | Persistent context across sessions | File-based JSON storage |

### 🖐️ Gesture Control Details

Edith's "Minority Report" interface uses your webcam to detect hand gestures:

| Gesture | Action |
|---------|--------|
| 🤏 **Double pinch** | System-wide click in Stark Mode |
| ✊ **Closed fist hold** | Hold mouse down and drag |
| ✋ **Open palm swipe up/down** | Mission Control / App Exposé |
| ✌️ **Peace-sign swipe** | Switch browser tabs left/right |

Stark Mode runs through [`hand_gesture_test.py`](/Users/ritu/Documents/GitHub/harv%202/harv/hand_gesture_test.py) with MediaPipe Tasks, the bundled [`public/hand_landmarker.task`](/Users/ritu/Documents/GitHub/harv%202/harv/public/hand_landmarker.task) model, and `pyautogui` for full-desktop macOS cursor control.

> **Tip**: Edith can toggle Stark Mode by voice: "activate stark mode", "enable stark mode", "disable it", "turn it off", or "stop it".
>
> **macOS requirement**: Grant Camera and Accessibility permissions to the Python interpreter or terminal running Edith, or cursor control will fail even if Stark Mode starts.

## 🛠️ Installation Requirements

### 🆕 Absolute Beginner Setup (Start Here)
If you have never coded before, follow these steps first!

**Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code (The Editor)**
- Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This is where you will write code and run commands.

**Step 2: Install Anaconda (The Manager)**
- Download [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (a lightweight version of Anaconda).
- This tool allows us to create isolated "playgrounds" (environments) for our code so different projects don't break each other.
- **Windows Users**: During install, check "Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable" (even if it says not recommended, it makes things easier for beginners).

**Step 3: Install Git (The Downloader)**
- **Windows**: Download [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
- **Mac**: Open the "Terminal" app (Cmd+Space, type Terminal) and type `git`. If not installed, it will ask to install developer tools—say yes.

**Step 4: Get the Code**
1. Open your terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows).
2. Type this command and hit Enter:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nazirlouis/harv.git
   ```
3. This creates a folder named `harv`.

**Step 5: Open in VS Code**
1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to **File > Open Folder**.
3. Select the `harv` folder you just downloaded.
4. Open the internal terminal: Press `Ctrl + ~` (tilde) or go to **Terminal > New Terminal**.

---

### ⚠️ Technical Prerequisites
Once you have the basics above, continue here.

### 1. System Dependencies

**MacOS:**
```bash
# Audio Input/Output support (PyAudio)
brew install portaudio
```

**Windows:**
- No additional system dependencies required!

### 2. Python Environment
Create a single Python 3.11 environment:

```bash
conda create -n harv python=3.11
conda activate harv

# Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Playwright browsers
playwright install chromium
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
Requires **Node.js 18+** and **npm**. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) if not installed.

```bash
# Verify Node is installed
node --version  # Should show v18.x or higher

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install
```

### 4. 🔐 Face Authentication Setup
To use the secure voice features, Edith needs to know what you look like.

1. Take a clear photo of your face (or use an existing one).
2. Rename the file to `reference.jpg`.
3. Drag and drop this file into the `harv/backend` folder.
4. (Optional) You can toggle this feature on/off in `settings.json` by changing `"face_auth_enabled": true/false`.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration (`settings.json`)

The system creates a `settings.json` file on first run. You can modify this to change behavior:

| Key | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `face_auth_enabled` | `bool` | If `true`, blocks all AI interaction until your face is recognized via the camera. |
| `tool_permissions` | `obj` | Controls manual approval for specific tools. |
| `tool_permissions.generate_cad` | `bool` | If `true`, requires you to click "Confirm" on the UI before generating CAD. |
| `tool_permissions.run_web_agent` | `bool` | If `true`, requires confirmation before opening the browser agent. |
| `tool_permissions.write_file` | `bool` | **Critical**: Requires confirmation before the AI writes code/files to disk. |

---

### 5. 🖨️ 3D Printer Setup
Edith can slice STL files and send them directly to your 3D printer.

**Supported Hardware:**
- **Klipper/Moonraker** (Creality K1, Voron, etc.)
- **OctoPrint** instances
- **PrusaLink** (Experimental)

**Step 1: Install Slicer**
Edith uses **OrcaSlicer** (recommended) or PrusaSlicer to generate G-code.
1. Download and install [OrcaSlicer](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer).
2. Run it once to ensure profiles are created.
3. Edith automatically detects the installation path.

**Step 2: Connect Printer**
1. Ensure your printer and computer are on the **same Wi-Fi network**.
2. Open the **Printer Window** in Edith (Cube icon).
3. Edith automatically scans for printers using mDNS.
4. **Manual Connection**: If your printer isn't found, use the "Add Printer" button and enter the IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.50`).

---

### 6. 🔑 Gemini API Key Setup
Edith uses Google's Gemini API for voice and intelligence. You need a free API key.

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. Click **"Create API Key"** and copy the generated key.
4. Create a file named `.env` in the `harv` folder (same level as `README.md`).
5. Add this line to the file:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
6. Replace `your_api_key_here` with the key you copied.

> **Note**: Keep this key private! Never commit your `.env` file to Git.

---

## 🚀 Running Edith

You have two options to run the app. Ensure your `harv` environment is active!

### Option 1: The "Easy" Way (Single Terminal)
The app is smart enough to start the backend for you.
1. Open your terminal in the `harv` folder.
2. Activate your environment: `conda activate harv`
3. Run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. The backend will start automatically in the background.

### Option 2: The "Developer" Way (Two Terminals)
Use this if you want to see the Python logs (recommended for debugging).

**Terminal 1 (Backend):**
```bash
conda activate harv
python backend/server.py
```

**Terminal 2 (Frontend):**
```bash
# Environment doesn't matter here, but keep it simple
npm run dev
```

### Localhost Links

- Frontend (Vite): http://localhost:5173
- Backend status: http://127.0.0.1:8000/status
- Backend companion status: http://127.0.0.1:8000/companions

When you use `npm run dev`, Electron still opens the desktop shell, but the frontend dev server is hosted at `http://localhost:5173` underneath.

---

## Cloud Backend + Local Companion

If you want Edith hosted in the cloud but still able to control a personal Mac, printer, clipboard, and local apps, run Edith in two parts:

1. Deploy the backend and frontend to your server.
2. Set `EDITH_REQUIRE_COMPANION=1` on the hosted backend so machine actions do not fall back to the cloud host.
3. Set the same `EDITH_COMPANION_TOKEN` on the backend and on each trusted companion machine.
4. Run the local companion on the target Mac:

```bash
cd harv
./.venv/bin/python backend/edith_companion.py \
  --server https://your-edith-server.example.com \
  --token your-shared-companion-token \
  --id primary-mac \
  --name "Ritu Mac"
```

The hosted backend can then route local-machine actions through that companion. Current companion-routed actions include:

- opening and closing Mac apps
- reading and writing the clipboard
- listing printers and printing files
- opening files on the connected machine

Use `GET /status` or `GET /companions` on the backend to confirm that a companion is connected.

## ✅ First Flight Checklist (Things to Test)

1. **Voice Check**: Say "Hello Ada". She should respond.
2. **Vision Check**: Look at the camera. If Face Auth is on, the lock screen should unlock.
3. **CAD Check**: Open the CAD window and say "Create a cube". Watch the logs.
4. **Web Check**: Open the Browser window and say "Go to Google".
5. **Smart Home**: If you have Kasa devices, say "Turn on the lights".

---

## ▶️ Commands & Tools Reference

### 🗣️ Voice Commands
- "Switch project to [Name]"
- "Create a new project called [Name]"
- "Turn on the [Room] light"
- "Make the light [Color]"
- "Pause audio" / "Stop audio"

### 🧊 3D CAD
- **Prompt**: "Create a 3D model of a hex bolt."
- **Iterate**: "Make the head thinner." (Requires previous context)
- **Files**: Saves to `projects/[ProjectName]/output.stl`.

### 🌐 Web Agent
- **Prompt**: "Go to Amazon and find a USB-C cable under $10."
- **Note**: The agent will auto-scroll, click, and type. Do not interfere with the browser window while it runs.

### 🖨️ Printing & Slicing
- **Auto-Discovery**: Edith automatically finds printers on your network.
- **Slicing**: Click "Slice & Print" on any generated 3D model.
- **Profiles**: Edith intelligently selects the correct OrcaSlicer profile based on your printer's name (e.g., "Creality K1").

## ❓ Troubleshooting FAQ

### Camera not working / Permission denied (Mac)
**Symptoms**: Error about camera access, or video feed shows black.

**Solution**:
1. Go to **System Preferences > Privacy & Security > Camera**.
2. Ensure your terminal app (e.g., Terminal, iTerm, VS Code) has camera access enabled.
3. Restart the app after granting permission.

---

### `GEMINI_API_KEY` not found / Authentication Error
**Symptoms**: Backend crashes on startup with "API key not found".

**Solution**:
1. Make sure your `.env` file is in the root `harv` folder (not inside `backend/`).
2. Verify the format is exactly: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key` (no quotes, no spaces).
3. Restart the backend after editing the file.

---

### WebSocket connection errors (1011)
**Symptoms**: `websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosedError: 1011 (internal error)`.

**Solution**:
This is a server-side issue from the Gemini API. Simply reconnect by clicking the connect button or saying "Hello Ada" again. If it persists, check your internet connection or try again later.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

| Limitation | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **macOS & Windows** | Tested on macOS 14+ and Windows 10/11. Linux is untested. |
| **Camera Required** | Face auth and gesture control need a working webcam. |
| **Gemini API Quota** | Free tier has rate limits; heavy CAD iteration may hit limits. |
| **Network Dependency** | Requires internet for Gemini API (no offline mode). |
| **Single User** | Face auth recognizes one person (the `reference.jpg`). |

---

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here's how:

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. **Commit** your changes: `git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`
4. **Push** to the branch: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
5. **Open a Pull Request** with a clear description.

### Development Tips

- Run the backend separately (`python backend/server.py`) to see Python logs.
- Use `npm run dev` without Electron during frontend development (faster reload).
- The `projects/` folder contains user data—don't commit it to Git.

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| **API Keys** | Stored in `.env`, never committed to Git. |
| **Face Data** | Processed locally, never uploaded. |
| **Tool Confirmations** | Write/CAD/Web actions can require user approval. |
| **No Cloud Storage** | All project data stays on your machine. |

> [!WARNING]
> Never share your `.env` file or `reference.jpg`. These contain sensitive credentials and biometric data.
